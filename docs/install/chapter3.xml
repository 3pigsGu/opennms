  <section>
    <title>Debian</title>

    <para>OpenNMS is supported on Debian, and can be installed using apt.
    However, due to licensing issues, we cannot distribute a version of Sun's
    Java SDK, so some extra steps are required.</para>

      <title>Woody</title>

      <para>Add the following to /etc/apt/sources.list and update, (i.e.
      "apt-get update"):</para>

      <para><computeroutput>deb http://debian.opennms.org/ debian/opennms
      stable</computeroutput></para>

      <para>Then obtain and install a suitable version of java.</para>

      <para>Because of licensing issues, a suitable java sdk cannot be
      distributed with OpenNMS so you will have to obtain and install one
      yourself prior to installing OpenNMS. You have several options
      here:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Use the sun-jdk1.4-installer package and build script to
          download the j2sdk from Sun and build your own j2sdk1.4 package,

              <para> The java-common package is a dependency for the j2sdk1.4
              package you will be creating, and since it will be installed by
              dpkg, APT will not be there to pull it in so install it
              first.</para>
