  <title>Overview</title>

  <para>OpenNMS is the world's first enterprise-grade network management
  system developed under the open source model. As with any complex and
  powerful system, getting it installed and configured can take a little
  effort. It is the purpose of this document to explain what is required to
  get OpenNMS installed.</para>

  <para>So, how should you use this document? It is arranged in the following
  sections:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>This Overview</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>The programs on which OpenNMS depends, and how they need to be
      modified</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Distribution Specific Installation Instructions</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Troubleshooting and Where to Get Help</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>This installation guide relies strongly on the idea of "packages."
  Most modern operating systems and distributions have a system where software
  can be installed and managed through the use of packages that group the
  files belonging to a given application together (as well as managing changes
  to those files, removal, upgrades, etc.).</para>

  <para>Please see the latest <ulink
  url="https://sourceforge.net/docman/?group_id=4141">release notes</ulink> to
  see if your operating system is supported. Currently OpenNMS runs on many
  Linux distributions, Solaris and Mac OS X.</para>

  <para>This guide assumes that if you use packages, you do so consistently.
  This is because OpenNMS will attempt to determine if the software it
  requires is installed by using the operating system's built in package
  management system. If you've installed, say, Java, but not via packages,
  OpenNMS will be unable to determine that Java is installed and it will
  fail.</para>

  <para>To get back to the original question of "how should you use this
  document," first go through the second section to insure that you have all
  of the prerequisite applications properly installed and configured. Use the
  third section to help get those packages installed for your particular
  operating system, as well as the OpenNMS software. Finally, use the last
  section to help correct any errors your might encounter.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Minimum Requirements</title>

    <para>While it is impossible to exactly size OpenNMS for a particular
    environment, the following represents the minimum requirements for
    installation, assuming a network of about 200 devices. Note that OpenNMS
    can monitor more than 100 times that given the proper hardware.</para>

    <glosslist>
      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>Processor</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>A 1 GHz Pentium III (or equivalent processor) or better.
          OpenNMS can also take advantage of multiple processors.</para>
        </glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>Memory</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>A minimum of 256 MB of RAM, although 512 MB is strongly
          recommended. The OpenNMS Java Virtual Machine benefits from large
          amounts of memory, up to 2 GB.</para>
        </glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry>
        <glossterm>Disk Space</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>OpenNMS requires about 25 MB of disk space for the program
          files. In addition, each data variable collected requires, by
          default, 283 KB of disk space. It is safe to assume that each
          interface being managed will require around 2 MB of disk space, so
          for 200 interfaces you are looking at 400 MB (conservatively).
          Depending on the number of events stored, you can assume 100 MB to
          200 MB are required for the database. Finally, the OpenNMS logs can
          grow quite large, especially in debug mode. Edit the
          <filename>log4j.properties</filename> file in the OpenNMS
          configuration directory (usually
          <filename>/opt/OpenNMS/etc</filename> or
          <filename>/etc/opennms</filename>) to change those settings. For a
          minimum system, 800 MB to 1 GB should be sufficient.</para>
