  <title>Troubleshooting an OpenNMS Installation</title>

  <section>
    <title>Common Installation Issues</title>

    <para>The following section contains advice for overcoming common
    installation issues.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Dependency Problems</title>

      <para>To assist with code management, the easiest way to install OpenNMS
      is via packages. Every effort has been made to insure that the packages
      OpenNMS depends on are required before the OpenNMS package can be
      installed. You should be able to find those packages on the distribution
      CDs that came with your system. For some of the more obscure packages,
      like <filename>metamail</filename>, you can visit the OpenNMS <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.opennms.org">FTP</ulink> site and check in the
      <filename>/pub/dependencies</filename> directory. In addition, sites
      like <ulink url="http://distro.ibiblio.org/">Ibiblio</ulink> and <ulink
      url="http://www.freshrpms.net">FreshRPMs</ulink> are also good
      sources.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>The OpenNMS Application Won't Start</title>

      <para>If the OpenNMS is installed, and the packages were not forced in
      using options like "--nodeps", the application should run just fine. If
      not, OpenNMS has a robust logging facility. Change to the logs directory
      (usually <filename>/var/log/opennms</filename>) and search the logs,
      using <filename>grep</filename> or your tool of choice, for words like
      FATAL and ERROR (the two highest log severities). Those events should
      give you clues as to why OpenNMS is not working.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>The OpenNMS Web Application Will Not Start, or You Can't Log
      In</title>

      <para>There are actually two main applications in the OpenNMS product:
      the application itself and the web-based User Interface (webUI). The
      webUI is implemented via Tomcat, and it is possible for Tomcat to be
      running and the OpenNMS application to be stopped and vice versa.</para>

      <para>If you can't get to the OpenNMS interface
      (<filename>http://[opennms server]:8080/opennms</filename> or
      <filename>http://[opennms server]:8180/opennms</filename> on Debian -
      where [opennms server] is the name of the OpenNMS machine) make sure
      that Tomcat is running, and if necessary restart it. You should also be
      able to access the main Tomcat page by leaving of the
      "<filename>/opennms</filename>".</para>

    <title>Where to Get Help</title>

    <para>OpenNMS is a community supported project. Please keep that in mind
    when seeking help on the program, as no one gets paid to work on the
    project (unless it is through a commercial support contract).</para>

    <section>
      <title>The OpenNMS Web Site</title>

      <para>The main OpenNMS <ulink url="http://www.opennms.org">site</ulink>
      is a Wiki. As a community project, there is a lot of good advice and
      information available there.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>The OpenNMS Mailing Lists</title>

      <para>OpenNMS maintains a number of active mailing lists on
      Sourceforge:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>opennms-announce: A low traffic, moderated mailing list for
          OpenNMS announcements. All posts to this list are duplicated on the
          opennms-discuss list.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>opennms-cvs: This is a fairly high traffic list of all updates
          to the CVS repositories on SourceForge. Moderated. Only CVS updates
          are posted here (no discussion).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>opennms-devel: This list is for code development
          discussion.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>opennms-discuss: This is the main OpenNMS discuss list. Pretty
          much anything goes here. It's pretty friendly. </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>opennms-install: This is a great list for new users to
          OpenNMS. The main focus is installation issues (cleared up by this
          great documentation, right?) but most "newbie" questions are welcome
          here.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>opennms-maps: Whether or not to use maps in network management
          is as divisive an issue as abortion or gun control (grin). OpenNMS
          does have a small contributed map system, which still needs a lot of
          work. We can talk about it here.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>opennms-ug-tokyo: We have a small users group in Tokyo, Japan.
          This list is for meeting announcements or help in Japanese.</para>
        </listitem>

      <title>Commercial Support</title>

      <para>If you are using OpenNMS in a production environment, or are
      considering it, you might be interested in commercial support. <ulink
      url="http://www.blast.com/opennms_about.html">Blast Internet
      Services</ulink> maintains the OpenNMS project, and we also offer
      support, training, consulting services and custom development. </para>
