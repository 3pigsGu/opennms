    <title>Are you sure you want to do this?</title>

    <para>OpenNMS is a complex software product, and it does not (yet) have a
    simple "./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install" build process
    like many other tools. If there is a packaged release for your operating
    system, we highly suggest you use that instead. If you have problems with
    a packaged release, please see the troubleshooting section for
    assistance.</para>

    <title>Download source</title>

    <para>You can download source for a specific release, or you can download
    source directly from the source code respository (CVS). You probably want
    to download released source unless you wish to do development or are
    looking for specific features or bug fixes that are not yet in a
    release.</para>
