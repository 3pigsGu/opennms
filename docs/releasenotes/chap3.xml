		<title>HTTP services may show false outages on upgrade</title>
		<para>
			Prior to 0.9.9, the HTTP service would be discovered if there was an httpd
			process listening on ports 80, 8000, or 8080. However, if the was a device
			with two or more httpd processes running, say on both 80 and 8080, and one
			died, as long as the other one was up no event would be generated. To
			address this, there are now three separate default services defined: HTTP
			(on port 80), HTTP-8000 (on port 8000) and HTTP-8080 (on port 8080 - natch).
		</para>
		<para>
			During an upgrade from previous versions to 0.9.9 or higher, note that
			devices which had no HTTP server on port 80 but one on another port will
			now show that their HTTP service is lost.  It can either be unmanaged or
			it will be automatically deleted after five days by default.

		<title>Reporting now sends an e-mail</title>
		<para>
			Rather than tying up the Web UI for a long period of time, Availability
			reports are now e-mailed to the address of the logged in user (generally
			"admin").  This means that we now require the 'metamail' package for
			encoding the report as an e-mail attachment.  Be warned that if you do
			not have it, you will not receive reports (although they will still
			exist in $OPENNMS_HOME/share).
