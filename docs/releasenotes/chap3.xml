		<title>Rare Incorrect Entries in the Outage Table</title>
		<para>
			Rarely, a service will show on the outage table that is actually
			operational. Investigation will show that the event that resolved
			the outage was written to the database at the same time as the
			event that caused the outage. This is due to the database being
			temporarily busy, and the "up" event getting into the queue just
			ahead of the "down" event, and occurs especially during a "vacuumdb".
			A fix is in process.
