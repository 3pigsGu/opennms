    <subtitle>Changes in This OpenNMS</subtitle>

    <para>OpenNMS 1.1.0 represents a refinement of the functionality
    introduced in 1.0.0. The 1.1 tree is a development, or &#34;unstable&#34;
    tree, implementing a number of new features but without the testing that
    went into 1.0. When 1.1 is mature enough, it will become 1.2, the next
    production or &#34;stable&#34; release.</para>

    <sect1 id="chap2sect1" label="2.1.">
      <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.1.2 and Above</title>

      <para>The following features were added in 1.1.2:</para>

      <bridgehead>Poller Improvements</bridgehead>

      <para>There are three new pollers available:</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Ssh:</emphasis> Previously, the SSH service
      was polled and discovered using the generic TCP class. This worked fine,
      except that SSH expects a version to be sent with the query. This causes
      numerous logs, thus the TCP class was modified into an SSH class that
      sends the correct version string.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">JDBC:</emphasis> The database pollers also
      use the TCP class to connect to well known ports. Jose Nunez Vicente
      Zuleta created a poller that uses the particular JDBC database driver to
      make a connection, get the system catelogs, and if successful, mark the
      database service as &#34;up&#34;. Since this requires a valid username
      and password that can access the database, it is not the default class,
      but it is pretty simple to set up.</para>

      <para>In order to automatically detect and monitor databases, a few
      changes need to be made to both the network and the OpenNMS
      configuration. First, be sure that the username and password you plan to
      use actually works from the OpenNMS server. This will involve changes to
      pg_hba.conf for PostgreSQL, and I am not sure about others.</para>

      <para>Second, you will need to insure that you have a jar file with the
      JDBC driver for your particular database. Copy it to $OPENNMS_HOME/lib
      (the one for PostgreSQL is already included).</para>

      <para>Okay, now you need to modify the capsd configuration to discover
      the service and modify the poller configuration to poll the service.</para>

      <para>capsd: Here&#39;s an example for Sybase:</para>

      <para><programlisting>&#60;protocol-plugin protocol=&#34;Sybase-JDBC&#34; class-name=&#34;org.opennms.netmgt.capsd.JDBCPlugin&#34; scan=&#34;on&#34;&#62;

&#60;/protocol-plugin&#62;</programlisting></para>

      <para>and one for MySql:<programlisting>&#60;protocol-plugin protocol=&#34;MySQL-JDBC&#34; class-name=&#34;org.opennms.netmgt.capsd.JDBCPlugin&#34; scan=&#34;on&#34;&#62;

&#60;/protocol-plugin&#62;</programlisting></para>

      <para>and one for PostgreSQL:</para>

      <programlisting>&#60;protocol-plugin protocol=&#34;PostgreSQL-JDBC&#34; class-name=&#34;org.opennms.netmgt.capsd.JDBCPlugin&#34; scan=&#34;on&#34;&#62;
        &#60;property key=&#34;user&#34; value=&#34;opennms&#34;/&#62;
        &#60;property key=&#34;password&#34; value=&#34;opennms&#34;/&#62;

&#60;/protocol-plugin&#62;</programlisting>

      <para>Note that the service names for all three of these examples have
      &#34;-JDBC&#34; added to the end of their names. This means you can run
      them separately from the standard database protocols, or if you like,
      you can completely replace the standard protocols. In fact, if you wish,
      you can use the standard port check in capsd, and then use the JDBC
      poller configuration to do the actual polling.</para>

      <para>Here are the poller configuration examples:</para>

      <para>One more thing in the poller-configuration file, you&#39;ll need
      to add &#60;monitor&#62; tags at the bottom:</para>

      <programlisting>  &#60;monitor service=&#34;Sybase-JDBC&#34; class-name=&#34;org.opennms.netmgt.poller.JDBCMonitor&#34;/&#62;

  &#60;monitor service=&#34;PostgreSQL-JDBC&#34; class-name=&#34;org.opennms.netmgt.poller.JDBCMonitor&#34;/&#62;</programlisting>

      <para>Hats off to Jose for this work.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">General Purpose Script Poller:</emphasis>
      Bill Ayres has written a poller that will execute a script, and based on
      the response from that script it will mark the service as being
      &#34;up&#34; or &#34;down&#34;, called the &#34;General Purpose&#34; or
      &#34;Gp&#34; Poller. He has used it to monitor RADIUS servers, for
      example.</para>

      <para>GpPlugin and GpMonitor work much like TcpPlugin and TcpMonitor in
      that you can use them to define as many custom services as you need,
      each with a unique service name.</para>

      <para>GpPlugin and GpMonitor call an external script or program to test
      a particular service. The script will be passed the IP address of the
      interface OpenNMS is testing ( as --hostname [IP Address]), followed by
      the timeout (as --timeout [timeout]), followed by any optional arguments
      that may need to passed.</para>

      <para>The script is expected to return a string as standard output which
      is then compared to the banner property or parameter to determine
      success or failure of the test.</para>

      <para>The timeout is implemented in GpPlugin and GpMonitor. However,
      some scripts may want to know how long OpenNMS is going to wait for a
      reply, so the timeout value is passed to the script, and can be ignored
      by the script if it is not needed.</para>

      <para>GpPlugin and GpMonitor also check the exit status of the script or
      program. If it is not zero, then the test fails. They will also gather
      and log any standard error output from the script, but the presence of
      error output does not prevent the test from succeeding if the banner
      matches the standard output.</para>

      <para>Example poller parameters are shown below. All of these are
      optional except script, which is required, and will cause an exception
      to be logged if it&#39;s missing.</para>

      <para>Example plugin properties are also shown below. All of these are
      optional except script, which is required, and will cause an exception
      to be logged if it&#39;s missing.</para>

      <para>These programs use the exec method from Java&#39;s Runtime class.
      Exec is known to have pitfalls. (See <ulink url="???">When
      Runtime.exec() won&#39;t</ulink>) Also, exec doesn&#39;t have a built-in
      timeout feature. In deciding what to do about these shortcomings, Bill
      discovered that Scott McCrory has already done it with his ExecRunner
      class. ExecRunner and StreamGobbler are at <ulink url="???">Sourceforge</ulink>
      as part of <ulink url="???">Spumoni</ulink>.</para>

      <para>One more word about the timeout. ExecRunner expects the timeout in
      integer seconds, not milliseconds, and a value of zero means wait
      indefinitely. To avoid confusion, Bill maintained the OpenNMS practice
      of specifying the timeout in milliseconds. Before passing it on to
      ExecRunner, it gets converted to seconds in the following manner: Zero
      remains zero, 1 thru 1999 gets converted to 1 second, 2000 thru 2999
      -&#62; 2 seconds, 3000 thru 3999 -&#62; 3 seconds, etc.</para>

      <para>Included in contrib is a simple perl test script,
      <filename>gptest.pl</filename>, that is handy for testing, since
      it&#39;s easy to edit and change its behaviour.</para>

      <para>To implement Gp, add the following entries, substituting your
      information as needed.</para>

      <para>For capsd configuration:</para>

      <programlisting>&#60;protocol-plugin protocol=&#34;GPtest&#34; class-name=&#34;org.opennms.netmgt.capsd.GpPlugin&#34; scan=&#34;on&#34; user-defined=&#34;true&#34;&#62;

   &#60;property key=&#34;args&#34; value=&#34;caps-arg1 caps-arg2&#34;/&#62;

   &#60;property key=&#34;retry&#34; value=&#34;1&#34;/&#62;
&#60;/protocol-plugin&#62;</programlisting>

      <para>And for poller configuration:</para>

      <programlisting>&#60;service name=&#34;GPtest&#34; interval=&#34;300000&#34; user-defined=&#34;false&#34; status=&#34;on&#34;&#62;

   &#60;parameter key=&#34;ds-name&#34; value=&#34;GPtest&#34;/&#62;
&#60;/service&#62;</programlisting>

      <para>and the monitor service entry:</para>

      <programlisting>&#60;monitor service=&#34;GPtest&#34;   class-name=&#34;org.opennms.netmgt.poller.GpMonitor&#34;/&#62;</programlisting>

      <para>Hats off to Bill for this work, and to Scott for ExecRunner.</para>

      <bridgehead>Script Daemon</bridgehead>

      <para>Speaking of scripts, Jim Doble has written a daemon that will
      execute scripts based on events received or generated by OpenNMS, called
      ScriptD. This process, governed as usual from a configuration file,
      allows one to generally or specifically execute actions based on events
      in OpenNMS.</para>

      <para>The scripting language, as I understand it, is <ulink url="???">beanshell</ulink>.
      As Jim writes: <quote>You will notice that BeanShell is a lot like Java,
      but with some relaxed syntax. For example you don&#39;t have to define
      types for your variables, and attributes for which there are simple get
      methods can be accessed as properties (i.e. you can say event.uei or
      event.getUei() interchangably.) </quote></para>

      <para>There are 4 types of scripts that can be run: start-script,
      reload-script, stop-script, and event-script. When ScriptD starts it
      will run all of the commands in the <varname>&#60;start-script&#62;</varname>
      tags. Likewise, when ScriptD stops, it will run all of the commands in
      the <varname>&#60;stop-script&#62;</varname> tags. Also, there is a new
      event, <varname>uei.opennms.org/internal/reloadScriptConfig</varname>,
      which when received will run all of the <varname>&#60;reload-script&#62;</varname>
      tags.</para>

      <para>The final script type, <varname>&#60;event-script&#62;</varname>
      gets run when events are received. Event scripts can have one or more
      UEI elements, which specify the UEI&#39;s for which that script should
      run. If no UEI element is present, the script will run for all events.</para>

      <para>The scripts can make use of the <varname>SnmpTrapHelper</varname>
      class, which is a utility to make it easier to manipulate traps from a
      script.</para>

      <para>There is an example <filename>scriptd-configuration.xml
      </filename>file included in the <filename>$OPENNMS_HOME/etc</filename>
      directory.</para>

      <para>If you want to forward all SNMP traps to another machine as an
      SNMP trap, you would use the following event script:</para>

      <programlisting>        &#60;event-script language=&#34;beanshell&#34;&#62;

                event = bsf.lookupBean(&#34;event&#34;);

                if (event.snmp != null) {
                        log.debug(&#34;forwarding a trap&#34;);
                        snmpTrapHelper.forwardTrap(event, &#34;10.1.1.1&#34;, 162);
                }

        &#60;/event-script&#62;</programlisting>

      <para>This will forward the trap to 10.1.1.1, port 162. Note that the
      event will have SNMP information if the event is indeed an SNMP trap.
      Since internal OpenNMS events do not, you could use that to forward
      OpenNMS events as an SNMP trap to another system:</para>

      <programlisting>&#60;event-script language=&#34;beanshell&#34;&#62;

        event = bsf.lookupBean(&#34;event&#34;);

        if (event.snmp == null)
        {

                try {

                log.debug(&#34;Forwarding an OpenNMS event.&#34;);

                SnmpPduTrap trap = snmpTrapHelper.createV1Trap(&#34;.1.3.6.1.4.1.5813.1&#34;, &#34;10.1.1.16&#34;, 6, 1, 0);

                t_dbid = new Integer(event.dbid).toString();
                if (t_dbid != null)
                        snmpTrapHelper.addVarBinding(trap, &#34;.1.3.6.1.4.1.5813.2.1&#34;, &#34;OctetString&#34;, &#34;text&#34;, t_dbid);

      <bridgehead>Maps</bridgehead>

      <para>Okay, let&#39;s get this out in the open. I don&#39;t care for
      maps in network management. Yes, they are nice looking, but truely
      useful maps cannot be automated, and the manual process of generating
      maps takes more time than they are worth.</para>

      <para>That said, my opinions don&#39;t mean much in this project (grin)
      and if someone is willing to put in some work and write solid code I am
      more than willing to accept it. Thus, Derek Glidden decided to go and
      write a mapping system for OpenNMS.</para>

      <para>This will display the nodes as icons, and the current availability
      is displayed in color underneath it. You can view it in a tree mode or
      just as a list of icons, and the image will automatically refresh. The
      parenting relationships have to be manually set.</para>

      <para>The image is built and displayed using Scalable Vector Graphics
      (SVG). I think this is a great decision, but the downside is that the
      only SVG viewer I was able to get to work was from Adobe for Internet
      Explorer on Windows. I was not able to get SVG to work with Mozilla or
      Safari (on Mac). Using the system on IE was very clean and fast.</para>

      <para>There is the option to convert the SVG image to a PNG image. This
      is extremely processor intensive, takes a long time on a network of any
      size, and often fails. It is not recommended.</para>

      <para>Scared yet? (grin)</para>

      <para>For these reasons I am treating the current map implementation as
      contributed code (i.e. not supported). It is hoped, however, that Derek
      and others will work to make more improvements to the system.</para>

      <para>Okay, to get started, read the <filename>map.disable</filename>
      file in <filename>$OPENNMS_HOME/etc</filename>. You will need to copy
      this file to <filename>map.enable</filename>. This will add a
      &#34;Map&#34; menu item in the WebUI.</para>

      <para>You will also have to make some changes to the tomcat4
      configuration. First, you need to set <varname>headless</varname> equal
      to <varname>true</varname>, and second you should probably increase the
      memory available to Tomcat (especially if you are trying to use the SVG
      to PNG transcoder). <varname>OutOfMemory</varname> exceptions in Tomcat
      are indicative of a too small memory setting when trying to render the
      map.</para>

      <para>I know this whole things sounds a bit negative, but that is no
      reflection on Derek&#39;s work. He wrote very clean code and I like the
      architecture (SVG especially) that he came up with. The icons are cool,
      too. So hats off to Derek.</para>

      <para>But I am bracing myself for the onslaught of questions like
      <quote>&#34;Can I add a background?&#34;</quote>, <quote>&#34;Can I
      change the icons based on systemOID?&#34;</quote>, and <quote>&#34;Can I
      make submaps?&#34;</quote>. Patience, please.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="chap2sect2" label="2.2.">
      <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.1.1 and Above</title>

      <para>The following features were added in 1.1.1:</para>

      <bridgehead>Trap Handling</bridgehead>

      <para>SNMP Traps will now be associated with nodes if the IP address in
      the trap matches a known IP address in the database.</para>

      <para>If the IP Address is not known, OpenNMS will generate a newSuspect
      event to attempt to discover the device. This behavior can be disabled
      in the trapd-configuration.xml file.</para>

      <para>Added new trap definitions for Dell OpenManage, Foundry Networks
      and ADIC. Also added an updated mib2opennms program which improves the
      look of the output.</para>

      <bridgehead>Reports</bridgehead>

      <para>Added a new custom reporting module which allows one to create and
      save custom performance reports. It is called the Key SNMP Custom (KSC)
      Reporting Tool.</para>

      <para>Added buttons on the standard Performance and Response Time pages
      to allow the range to be changed between the last Day/Week/Month/Year.</para>

      <bridgehead>Response Time</bridgehead>

      <para>Added the ability to collect response time on the following
      pollers: Citrix, FTP, HTTPS, IMAP, POP3, SMTP and TCP.</para>

      <para>The RRAs for Response Time data are now part of the poller
      configuration file.</para>

      <bridgehead>Web Improvements</bridgehead>

      <para>There is now a Response Time link on the node and interface pages.</para>

      <para>If a node or interface supports HTTP, there is now a link to that
      service.</para>

      <para>Added a two minute refresh to the event listing page.</para>

      <bridgehead>Other Features</bridgehead>

      <para>Added non-blocking I/O to the HTTPS service. Now all monitors and
      plug-ins should be non-blocking.</para>

      <para>If you set the IP Address in a poll-outages calendar to
      &#34;match-any&#34; it will match all addresses in the poller package
      that uses that calendar.</para>

      <para>Increased the size of the contactinfo field in the usersnotified
      table, and changed create.sql to make this easier.</para>

      <bridgehead>Fixed Bugs</bridgehead>

      <para>Fixed numerous bugs, including 650 where &#34;down&#34; events
      could be written to the database after the corresponding &#34;up&#34;
      event. See the CHANGELOG for a full list.</para>

      <bridgehead>Tomcat4</bridgehead>

      <para>For a variety of reasons, OpenNMS 1.1.1 and beyond will require
      Tomcat4 version 4.1.18 or higher.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="chap2sect3" label="2.3.">
      <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.1.0 and Above</title>

      <para>There were many changes to OpenNMS between 1.0 and 1.1. Here are a
      few listed by functional area.</para>

      <bridgehead>Events and Event Handling</bridgehead>

      <para>The events and notifications part of OpenNMS saw the most changes
      with 1.1.0. First, there was a new tag added to the
      <filename>eventconf.xml</filename> file called &#60;event-file&#62;.
      This allows for external files to be included in the event
      configuration.</para>

      <para>Also, the order in which events appear is now strictly enforced.
      When trying to match an event with an event definition, OpenNMS takes
      the first match. The events in the <filename>eventconf.xml</filename>
      are read first, followed by the files identified by &#60;event-file&#62;
      tags (in the order in which they are listed). In the configuration that
      ships with OpenNMS, the file with the default events is loaded last. Be
      sure to add any custom files before that one.</para>

      <para>Prior to this release, the SNMP generic traps 0-5 (coldStart,
      warmStart, linkDown, etc.) were hard-coded. Now they must be defined
      (and that definition is included in the default events file), but this
      allows for generic traps other than type 6 to be configured differently
      for, say, different hosts.</para>

      <para>Speaking of event files, over 2750 events were added out of the
      box, including those from vendors such as Cisco, HP and 3Com. Please let
      us know if anything is misconfigured or if we need to add some events.</para>

      <para>The ability to configure events based on parameters (varbinds) was
      also added. This is best demonstrated with an example. In the new HP
      event definitions there is an event called hpicfFaultFinderTrap. It is
      defined as: <programlisting>&#60;event&#62; 
    &#60;mask&#62;
        &#60;maskelement&#62; 
            &#60;mename&#62;id&#60;/mename&#62;

      </programlisting></para>

      <para>This event, when added before the previous event since it is more
      specific, will try to match on the enterprise id, the generic trap value
      of 6, the specific trap value of 5 <emphasis>and</emphasis> the value of
      the third parameter, or varbind, of 3.</para>

      <para>There was also the addition of a low and high threshold rearm
      events. When a threshold is exceeded in consecutive polls equal to the
      trigger number, the threshold event is generated. Another event will not
      be generated until the polled value drops below the rearm number. The
      rearm event is thus similar to a &#34;cleared&#34; event. Since the
      first parameter passed with the threshold event is the data source name,
      using the &#34;varbind&#34; tag above, each data source can now have its
      own event.</para>

      <para>One of the more noticeable changes is that the Unique Event
      Identifier no longer contains &#34;http://&#34;. The original intent was
      that the UEI would act something like an XML namespace, but in practice
      it is just a label, so the &#34;http://&#34; was removed to avoid
      confusion.</para>

      <para>Notifications also received some attention with this release. Due
      to popular demand, the tags %nodelabel% and %interfaceresolve% are now
      available. The former will display the label of the nodeid associated
      with the event, and the latter will attempt to resolve the name
      associated with the IP Address of the interface of the event.</para>

      <para>In <filename>notifd-configuration.xml</filename> there are now two
      new attributes. In the global properties, there is &#34;match-all&#34;.
      By default, this is set to false, which means that the first
      notification that matches an event will be the only notification sent.
      If it is set to true, then all notifications that match a given event
      will be sent. (Thanks Nick) In the auto-acknowledge section, there is a
      new attribute called &#34;clear&#34;. By adding &#34;clear=true&#34; to
      the auto-acknowledge tag, both the event being auto acknowledged
      <emphasis>and</emphasis> the event that caused the acknowledgement will
      be acknowledged. Thus the &#34;up&#34; event that clears a
      &#34;down&#34; will also be cleared.</para>

      <para>In addition to these enhancements, various bugs were fixed.
      Notification rules now actually work, and you can filter node level
      events via IP address. Also, threshold events can now generate
      notifications.</para>

      <bridgehead>Polling</bridgehead>

      <para>The biggest change to polling would have to be the addition of
      response time information for DHCP, DNS, HTTP and ICMP based pollers.
      Similar to data collection, the response time information can be graphed
      and it can have threshold alarms placed on it.</para>

      <para>Also, all of the plugins and monitors (except HTTPS) have been
      re-written to use the non-blocking I/O available in the 1.4 JDK.</para>

      <bridgehead>Discovery</bridgehead>

      <para>There has been some discussion on how OpenNMS determines node
      labels. Currently, this is set to the resolved SNMP Primary Interface IP
      Address. However, it is common practice on routers to have a
      software-loopback address. OpenNMS will now discover such interfaces (as
      long as they do not have an address that starts with 127) and mark them
      as the primary SNMP Interface. Note that no services will be polled on
      such interfaces.</para>

      <bridgehead>The Web User Interface</bridgehead>

      <para>A few changes were made to the WebUI. There is now a
      webui-colors.xml file that will allow for dynamic changes to the
      background colors used in the categories list on the main page (more
      pages to follow). Also under &#34;Admin&#34; the ability to delete nodes
      was added.</para>

      <para>In addition, there is a new Admin page that will allow one to
      choose which non-IP interfaces will be used in data collection. By
      setting the snmpStorageFlag in <filename>datacollection-config.xml</filename>
      to &#34;select&#34; (now the default), OpenNMS will only store data from
      those interfaces that could serve as a primary SNMP interface. One can
      then select which other interfaces to collect on using the GUI. The
      previous values of snmpStorageFlag (&#34;primary&#34; and &#34;all&#34;)
      still work.</para>

      <para>Also, the &#34;Destination Path&#34; interface now has the ability
      to choose NOT to include a service (thanks Nick) which will create a
      rule like &#34;match the events where service is NOT FTP&#34;, and by
      placing the mouse over the categories on the main page, the last time
      the category was updated should be displayed.</para>

      <bridgehead>Fixed Service Deletion in Downtime Model</bridgehead>

      <para>The poller downtime model allows for a service to be deleted if it
      has been down for a certain amount of time. This did not work correctly
      and has been fixed.</para>

      <bridgehead>Reduced the Amount of Data Initially Collected from the
      ifTable</bridgehead>

      <para>During discovery, the ifTable is collected from each device that
      is found to support SNMP. On some HP switches, this would fail due to a
      limitation on the SNMP maximum packet size. All non-essential ifTable
      elements were removed from the request that appears to resolve the
      problem.</para>

      <bridgehead>Removed Spaces in Notification Path Names</bridgehead>

      <para>Spaces in Notification Path names have been known to cause
      problems. The Web UI was modified to disallow spaces in path names. Bug
      657.</para>

      <bridgehead>Fixed the AM/PM Ordering on Performance Report UI.</bridgehead>

      <para>In the Custom Performance Report Web UI, 11 PM was followed by 12
      PM, when it should have been 12 AM. This has been corrected. Bug 515.</para>

      <bridgehead>Added a &#34;contrib&#34; Directory</bridgehead>

      <para>The &#34;contrib&#34; directory now contains code, such as nifty
      utilities, that exists outside of the main OpenNMS source but may prove
      useful. One such example is Tomas Carlsson&#39;s &#34;mib2opennms&#34;
      program. These programs are not supported.</para>

      <bridgehead>Removed Duplicate Entries in <filename>capsd-configuration.xml</filename></bridgehead>

      <para>Both LDAP and Citrix protocol plug-ins were listed twice. This
      would slow down the capabilities scan considerably.</para>

      <bridgehead>Updated Data Collection and Graphing</bridgehead>

      <para>Added new entries to <filename>datacollection-config.xml</filename>
      and <filename>snmp-graph.properties</filename>.</para>

      <bridgehead>Bugfixes</bridgehead>

      <para>Many bugfixes, including allowing Threshold events to generate
      notifications, AdminStatus and OperStatus values causing exceptions, and
      rescans with certain devices.</para>

    <sect1 id="chap2sect4" label="2.4.">
      <title>Changes in OpenNMS 1.0.0 and Above</title>

      <para>The following major changes occurred between 0.9.9 and 1.0.0:</para>

      <bridgehead>OpenSSH service is now &#34;SSH&#34;</bridgehead>

      <para>The OpenSSH service has been renamed to &#34;SSH&#34; and changed
      to detect common versions of SSH servers other than OpenSSH. Upgrades
      will retain the &#34;OpenSSH&#34; service as well for the sake of
      reports.</para>

      <bridgehead>&#34;Service Unresponsive&#34; support</bridgehead>

      <para>There is now the possibility of having a state between
      &#34;up&#34; and &#34;down&#34; that flags a service as being
      unresponsive. This state can be reached when the service&#39;s port can
      be connected to, but it doesn&#39;t respond in a reasonable amount of
      time.</para>

      <bridgehead>Bugfixes</bridgehead>

      <para>Many small bugfixes, including the &#34;Calculating...&#34;
      problem if RTC hasn&#39;t come up yet when tomcat starts.</para>
