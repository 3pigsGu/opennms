		OpenNMS 1.0.0 and greater represent a huge leap in the maintainability,
		stability, and reduction of resource usage of the OpenNMS platform.  It
		was largely a rewrite of the code that has been in development for
		about 2 years, resulting in a considerably cleaner code base that will
		be easier to manage in the long term.
