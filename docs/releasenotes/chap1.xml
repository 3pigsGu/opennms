  <subtitle>About This Release</subtitle>

  <para>Release 1.1.4 is the release candidate for 1.2 - the next stable
  branch of OpenNMS. It represents a tremendous amount of work in the areas of
  speed and performance. It incorporates many changes and bug fixes to make
  OpenNMS more Java centric - including a new installer. Current production
  users should note that this release contains a lot more changes to the
  underlying code than any release since 1.1.0, so if you are currently happy
  with 1.1.3 or an earlier version, you may want to wait a week or two before
  upgrading, or wait until 1.2.</para>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.1.3 is a major milestone on the way to the next stable
  release, 1.2. It contains a number of improvements, especially under the
  covers, and is the first release created under the new build system.</para>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.1.2 adds several new features and bug fixes. New features
  include a JDBC poller, a script-based poller and script-based event handler,
  as well as contributed support for a map.</para>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.1.1 is the next step towards the production 1.2 release. It
  contains a number of new features and bug fixes.</para>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.1 extends the work that was begun with 1.0 to make OpenNMS
  more powerful and easier to use. Almost all of the new functionality was
  suggested by current OpenNMS users. It is hoped that these improvements will
  prove useful, and will lead to even more suggestions on how to improve the
  product.</para>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.0.2 is a maintenance release that fixes several code
  issues.</para>

  <para>OpenNMS 1.0.1 is a maintenance release that fixes several code
