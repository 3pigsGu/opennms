[[user-guide-surveillance-view]]
== OpenNMS Surveillance View

When networks are larger and contain devices of different priority, it becomes interesting to show at a
glance how the "whole system" is working. The surveillance view aims to do that. By using categories, you
can define a matrix which allows to aggregate monitoring results. Imagine you have 10 servers with 10
internet connections and some 5 pcs with Dsl lines:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
|                    | Servers | Internet Connections
| Super important    | 1 of 10 | 0 of 10
| Slightly important | 0 of 10 | 0 of 10
| Vanity             | 4 of 10 | 0 of 10
|===

The whole idea is to give somebody at a glance a hint on where the trouble is. The matrix-type of display
allows a significantly higher aggregation than the simple list. In addition, the surveillance view shows
nodes rather than services - an important tidbit of information when you look at categories. At a glance,
you want to know how many of my servers have an issue rather than how many services in this category have
an issue.

.Example of a configured _Surveillance view_

This _Surveillance View_ model is also the foundation of the <<user-guide-dashboard, Dashboard View>>.
_Surveillance Views_ are defined in the `surveillance-views.xml` and can be modified using the
_Surveillance View Configurations_ editor on the admin page.

.The _Surveillance View Configurations_ UI

You can use user and group names for _Surveillance Views_. When the _Surveillance View_ page is invoked
the following criteria selects the proper _Surveillance View_ to be displayed. The first matching item
wins:

. Surveillance View name equal to the user name they used when logging into OpenNMS.
. Surveillance View name equal to the user's assigned OpenNMS group name
. Surveillance View name equal to the 'default-view' attribute in the surveillance-views.xml configuration file.
