== OpenNMS Surveillance View

When networks are larger and contain devices of different priority, it becomes interesting to show at a glance how the "whole system" is working.
The surveillance view aims to do that. By using categories, you can define a matrix which allows to aggregate monitoring results.
Imagine you have 10 servers with 10 internet connections and some 5 PCs with DSL lines:

[options="header, autowidth"]
|===
|                    | Servers | Internet Connections
| Super important    | 1 of 10 | 0 of 10
| Slightly important | 0 of 10 | 0 of 10
| Vanity             | 4 of 10 | 0 of 10
|===

The whole idea is to give somebody at a glance a hint on where the trouble is.
The matrix-type of display allows a significantly higher aggregation than the simple list.
In addition, the surveillance view shows nodes rather than services - an important tidbit of information when you look at categories.
At a glance, you want to know how many of my servers have an issue rather than how many services in this category have an issue.

This _Surveillance View_ model is also the foundation of the <<user-guide-dashboard, Dashboard View>>.
_Surveillance Views_ are defined in the `surveillance-views.xml`.

=== Categorizing Nodes

In order to categorize nodes in the Surveillance View, choose a node and click _Edit_ beside _Surveillance Category Memberships_.
Recalling from your _Surveillance View_, choose two categories that represent a column and a row, for example, _Servers_ and _Test_, then click _Add_.

=== Creating Views for Users and Groups

You can use user and group names for _Surveillance Views_. When the _Surveillance View_ page is invoked the following criteria selects the proper _Surveillance View_ to be displayed.
The first matching item wins:

. Surveillance View name equal to the user name they used when logging into OpenNMS.
. Surveillance View name equal to the user's assigned OpenNMS group name
. Surveillance View name equal to the 'default-view' attribute in the surveillance-views.xml configuration file.
