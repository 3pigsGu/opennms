=== GraphML

In {opennms-product-name} the `GraphMLTopoloyProvider` uses http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/[GraphML] formatted files to visualize graphs.

____
GraphML is a comprehensive and easy-to-use file format for graphs.
It consists of a language core to describe the structural properties of a graph and a flexible extension mechanism to add application-specific data.
 [...]
Unlike many other file formats for graphs, GraphML does not use a custom syntax.
Instead, it is based on XML and hence ideally suited as a common denominator for all kinds of services generating, archiving, or processing graphs.
____

{opennms-product-name} does not support the full feature set of GraphML.
The following features are not supported: Nested graphs, Hyperedges, Ports and Extensions.
For more information about GraphML refer to the http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/primer/graphml-primer.html[Official Documentation].

A basic graph definition using GraphML usually consists of the following GraphML elements:

 * Graph element to describe the graph
 * Key elements to define custom properties, each element in the GraphML document can define as data elements
 * Node and Edge elements
 * Data elements to define custom properties, which {opennms-product-name} will then interpret.

A very minimalistic example is given below:

[source, xml]
----
include::examples/minimalistic.xml[]
----
<1> The optional label of the menu entry.
<2> The graph definition.
<3> Each graph must have a namespace, otherwise {opennms-product-name} refuses to load the graph.
<4> Node definitions.

==== Create/Update/Delete GraphML Topology

In order to create a GraphML Topology, a valid GraphML xml file must exist.
Afterwards this is send to the {opennms-product-name} REST API to create it:

[source, shell]
----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -u admin:admin -d@graph.xml 'http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/graphml/topology-name'
----

The `topology-name` is a unique identifier for the Topology.
If a `label` property is defined for the Graphml element this is used to be displayed in the Topology UI, otherwise the `topology-name` defined here is used as a fallback.

To delete an already existing Topology a HTTP DELETE request must be send:

[source, shell]
----
curl -X DELETE -u admin:admin 'http://localhost:8980/opennms/rest/graphml/topology-name'
----

There is no PUT method available.
In order to update an existing GraphML Topology one must first delete and afterwards re-create it.

NOTE: Even if the HTTP Request was successful, it does not mean, that the Topology is actually loaded properly.
The HTTP Request states that the Graph was successfully received, persisted and is in a valid GraphML format.
However, the underlying `GraphMLTopologyProvider` may perform additional checks or encounters problems while parsing the file.
If the Topology does not show up, the `karaf.log` should be checked for any clues what went wrong.
In addition it may take a while before the Topology is actually selectable from the Topology UI.

==== Supported Attributes

A various set of GraphML attributes are supported and interpreted by {opennms-product-name} while reading the GraphML file.
The following table explains the supported attributes and for which GraphML elements they may be used.

.Supported properties
[options="header"]
|=======================
| Property                | Required | For element  | Default   | Description
| `namespace`             | yes      | Graph        | -         | The namespace must be unique overall existing Topologies.
| `description`           | no       | Graph        | -         | A description, which is shown in the Info Panel.
| `preferred-layout`      | no       | Graph        | `D3`      | Defines a preferred layout.
| `focus-strategy`        | no       | Graph        | `FIRST`   | Defines a focus strategy. More see <<gd-topology-graphml-focus-strategy>> for more information.
| `focus-ids`             | no       |Â Graph        | -         | Refers to nodes ids in the graph.
                                                                  This is required if `focus-strategy` is `SPECIFIC`.
                                                                  If multiple ids should be add to focus, they are separated by `,`.
                                                                  Example: `node1,node2`
| `semantic-zoom-level`   | no       | Graph        | `1`       | Defines the default SZL.
| `iconKey`               | no       | Node         | `generic` | Defines the icon. See <<gd-topology-graphml-icons>> for more information.
| `label`                 | no       | Graph, Node  | -         | Defines a custom label. If not defined, the `id` is used instead.
| `nodeID`                | no       | Node         | -         | Allows referencing the Vertex to a OpenNMS node.
| `tooltipText`           | no       | Node, Edge   |           | Defines a custom tooltip. If not defined, the `id` attribute is used instead.
|=======================

[[gd-topology-graphml-focus-strategy]]
==== Focus Strategies

A `Focus Strategy` defines which Vertices should be added to focus when selecting the Topology.
The following strategies are available:

* *EMPTY* No Vertex is add to focus.
* *ALL* All Vertices are add to focus.
* *FIRST* The first Vertex is add to focus.
* *SPECIFIC* Only Vertices which id match the graph's property `focus-ids` are added to focus.

[[gd-topology-graphml-icons]]
==== Icons

With the _GraphMLTopoloygProvider_ it is not possible to change the icon from the Topology UI.
Instead if a custom icon should be used, each node must contain a `iconKey` property referencing an SVG element.

==== Edge Status Provider

TODO

[[gd-topology-graphml-layers]]
==== Layers

The _GraphMLTopologyProvider_ can handle GraphML files with multiple graphs.
Each Graph is represented as a Layer in the Topology UI.
If a vertex from one graph has an edge pointing to another graph, one can navigate to that layer.
