		<title>Release 1.6.0</title>

		<para>Release 1.6.0 is the first stable release in the OpenNMS 1.6 series.</para>

		<para>It's been 3 and a half years since the last OpenNMS stable version, 1.2, was
		branched and released as production-ready.  In that time, OpenNMS as a project has
		changed tremendously, the community has grown exponentially, and massive numbers of
		new features have been incorporated into the "unstable" 1.3.x series.
		</para>

		<para>In that time, the unstable codebase solidified to the point that The OpenNMS
		Group supported it as if it were stable; it was <emphasis>at least</emphasis> as
		stable as 1.2.x was, but many users held off on upgrading because of the unstable
		moniker.</para>

		<para>After a lot of work, and a renewed focus on getting the next stable release
		out the door, we are now prepared to declare OpenNMS 1.6 release-candidate-ready.</para>

		<para>Why 1.6 instead of 1.4?  3 years is a lot of time, and a lot has happened
		in that time.  We're not ready to call it 2.0, we want to redo the web UI first,
		but 1.4 didn't really do the massive changes since 1.2 justice.  So: 1.6 it is.</para>

		<para>Since it is a lot easier to do a release than it was in the 1.2 series (now
		that the native code is moved out into separate packages, and OpenNMS itself is
		distributed as pure-java sources), the goal is to continue to be on a much faster
		6-month or year cycle for new releases.</para>

		<para>Please, let us know if you have any problems at all in our <ulink
		url="http://bugzilla.opennms.org/">Bugzilla bug tracker</ulink>.</para>
