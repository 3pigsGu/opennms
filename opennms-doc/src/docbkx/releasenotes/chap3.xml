					<title>OpenNMS 1.5.93</title>
					<para>OpenNMS is still not 100% compatible with PostgreSQL 8.3, because of
					a change in behavior regarding implicit casts.  Until we can fix our code to
					not rely on implicit casts, a workaround is available
					<ulink url="http://people.planetpostgresql.org/peter/index.php?/archives/18-Readding-implicit-casts-in-PostgreSQL-8.3.html">here</ulink>,
					but it is recommended that you stick with PostgreSQL 7.4 to 8.2 for production
					environments until this issue is resolved.</para>

					<title>OpenNMS 1.3.8 Known Issues</title>

					<para>The order of elements in some of the XML configuration files is
					enforced more strictly than before. This change may cause problems with
					customized OpenNMS configuration files (especially event definitions) that
					worked fine with previous releases. Correcting the ordering of elements in
					these files against the XML schema definitions (available from the <ulink
					url="http://www.opennms.org/">wiki</ulink>) may be necessary.</para>
