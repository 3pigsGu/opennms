==== Provide the database driver

The JDBCMonitor is based on _JDBC_ and requires a JDBC-Driver to comunicate with any database.
Due to the fact that OpenNMS it self is using a Postgrsql Database, the Postgresql JDBC-Driver is availible out of the box.
For all other database-systems a compatible JDBC-Driver has to be provided to OpenNMS as a _jar-file_.
To provide a JDBC-Driver place the _driver-jar_ in the `lib-folder` of your OpenNMS.
To use the JDBC-Monitor from a Remote-Poller, the _driver-jar_ has to be provided to the Remote-Poller too.

@TODO how to add a jar to the remote-poller

==== Examples
Some example configuration how to configure the monitor in the 'poller-configuration.xml'.
