=== VmwareMonitor

This monitor is part of the VMware integration provided in _Provisiond_ and test the power state of a virtual machine (VM) or a host system (host).
If the power state of a VM or host is _poweredOn_ the service is _up_.
For any other state like _standby_ or _off_ the service on the VM or Host is marked as _down_.

CAUTION: The information for the status of a virtual machine is collected from the responsible _VMware vCenter_ using the credentials from the 'vmware-config.xml'.
         It is also required to get specific asset fields assigned to an imported virtual machine and host system.
         The following asset fields are populated by the _VMware_ integration in _Provisiond_: _VMware Management Server_, _VMware Managed Entity Type_ and the _foreignId_ which contains an internal _VMware vCenter Identifier_.

WARNING: If you suspend VM and hosts, the service change to status _down_.
         This could cause some false alarms if you run in a dynamic environment where it is normal to put VMs or hosts in suspend state.
