=== Plugin Manager UI panel

The plugin manager is accessed as an entry in the OpenNMS Admin Gui 
image::plugin-manager/adminPageEntry.png[]

The Plugin manager administration page is split into six main areas as illustrated below.

1. Top left is the Karaf Instance data panel which lists the Karaf instances known to the Plugin Manager. When a Karaf instance is selected, the data on the rest of the page refers to the selected instance.

2. Bottom Left is the Available Plugins Server panel which is used to set the address and passwords to access the app server and / or the list of available plugins

3. Top Right, just below the main OpenNMS menu bar are links to three diagnostic pages which can help test the ReST interface to remote Karaf Instances

4. Middle Right is a messages panel which reports the status of any operations. If an operation fails, the full error message can be viewed by pressing the error message button

5. Bottom Right is a tabbed panel which reflects the status of the plugins and licences installed in the Karaf instance selected in the Karaf Instance data panel.

=== Setting Karaf Instance Data

The Karaf instances known to the Plugin Manager are listed in the Karaf Instance data panel. 

'Localhost' refers to the local OpenNMS server and is always an option in the panel. 

The karaf instance data is persisted locally and should be refreshed from remote sources using the reload Karaf instance data button before changes are made.

Each Karaf instance must have a unique system id which is used to update its configuration and also to validate its licences.

In most situations the remote Karaf instance can be accessed from the OpenNMS plugin manager. However in many cases, the remote Karaf will be behind a firewall in which case it must initiate the communications to request its configuration and supply an update on its status. 

The 'Remote is Accessible' field tells the plugin manager which mode of operation is in use.
