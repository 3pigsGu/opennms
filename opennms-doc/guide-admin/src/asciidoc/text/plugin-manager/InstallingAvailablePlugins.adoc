=== Installed Plugins

Under plugin settings, the Installed Plugins tab lists which plugins are currently installed in the karaf instance selected in the karaf instance data panel.

=== Available Plugins Server
The plugin manager obtains a list of available plugins from the 'Available Plugin's server'. This may also host the maven repo used to download the features.

Alternatively the local Plugin Manager can list the available plugins which have been installed as bundled Plugin Kar/RPM's on the local machine. In this case, the Plugin Server URL should be pointed at the localhost. The admin username and passwords are used to access the Available Plugins Server

If a shopping cart is provided for obtaining licences, the URL of the shopping cart should be filled in

=== Installing Available Plugins
The Available Plugins panel list the plugins which are available and listed by the Available Plugins server. These can be directly installed into the selected karaf instance or can be posted to a manifest for later installation.
If a plugin is installed, the system will try and start it. However if a corresponding licence is required and not installed, the features will be loaded but not started. You must restart the feature if you later install a licence key.

=== Plugins Manifest
The Plugins Manifest for a kiven karaf instance lists the target plugins which the karaf instance should install when it next contacts the licene manager. If the Plugin Manager can communicate with the remote server, then a manifest can be selected for installation.
A manual manifest entry can be created for a feature. This can be used to install features which are not listed in the Available Features list.
