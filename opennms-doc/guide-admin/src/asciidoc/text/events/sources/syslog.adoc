==== Syslog Messages

Syslog messages sent over the network to {opennms-product-name} can be transformed into events according to pre-configured rules.

IMPORTANT: The `Syslogd` service daemon, which enables {opennms-product-name} to receive syslog messages over the network, must be enabled for this functionality to work. This service daemon is *disabled* by default.
