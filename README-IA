OpenNMS Italian Adventures
 
This is only a test version and must be considered a pre-release.

You can build opennms IA in the same way of opennms HEAD branch.

The OpenNMS version this release is based on is: 1.2.3-1.

Contents of OpenNMS IA:

We introduce a new service named linkd.
This service polls snmp nodes to get information about;
 mac/ip addresses assosations
 Spanning Tree Protocol
 Bridge Mac Address Table
 Ip Routing Table

This informations are used bylinkd to discovery links (at Data Link Level of ISO/OSI standard)
among nodes.

Previus informations are saved into new tables in Db and can be
visualized on web interface looking for node.

Strictly related to this new service is provided an extention
of originally map built in OpenNMS. 
You can access them using map.enable stuff.

Another service buid in OpenNMS IA is the inventory.
Originally this service was written to store and compare
router/switch configuration as also to save operating system.

This process is useful to poll and get inventory info
from nodes and to saving them into XML files.
Look to xml configuration file and examples provided.

Also this information are stored in new db tables
and is provided integrated web user interface.

Some inventory collection are automatically saved in asset info
table.

Another stuff regard the user interface Asset Location where you can create
Building and Room and assigning nodes to them.
