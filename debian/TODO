- Move away from the ugly hacking of users pg_hba.conf file. Possibly use
  debconf to prompt for more reasonable settings.

- Institute a permissions scheme that will allow Tomcat to run as user
  tomcat4

- Figure out why Tomcat refuses to use web.xml as a symlink.

- Either the packages should readily support running the webapp, database,
  and app on seperate machines, or some of these packages should be merged
  back together.

- Write a man page.

- Look into lintian overrides
