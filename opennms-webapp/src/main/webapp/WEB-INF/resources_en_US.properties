search.allnodes=All nodes

search.assetinfo=Search Asset Information
search.category=Category:
search.field=Field:
search.containingtext=Containing text:
search.allnodesassetinfo=All nodes with asset info
search.contains=contains
search.equals=equals

search.options=Search Options
search.optionsdescript1=Searching by name is a case-insensitive, inclusive \
search. For example, searching on <em>serv</em> would find any of \
<em>serv</em>, <em>Service</em>, <em>Reserved</em>, <em>NTSERV</em>, \
<em>UserVortex</em>, etc. The underscore character acts as a wildcard.

search.optionsdescript2=Searching by TCP/IP address uses a very flexible search \
format, allowing you to separate the four octets (fields) of a TCP/IP address \
into specific searches.  An asterisk (*) in place of any octet matches any \
value for that octet. Ranges are indicated by two numbers separated by a \
dash (-), and commas are used for list demarcation.	

search.optionsdescript3=For example, the following search fields are all valid \
and would each create the same result set--all TCP/IP addresses from \
192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255:

search.optionsdescript4=A search for ifAlias, ifName, or ifDescr "contains" will find nodes with interfaces \
that match the given search string. This is a case-insensitive inclusive search \
similar to the "name" search described above. If the search modifier is "equals" rather \
than "contains" an exact match must be found.
		
search.optionsdescript5=To search by Service, click the down arrow and select \
the service you would like to search for.
                
search.optionsdescript6=Searching by MAC Address allows you to find interfaces \
with hardware (mac) addresses matching the search string. This is a \
case-insensitive partial string match. For example, you can find all \
interfaces with a specified manufacturer's code by entering the first 6 \
characters of the mac address. Octet separators (dash or colon) are optional.

search.optionsdescript7=Searching for assets allows you to search for all \
assets which have been associated with a particular category, as well as to \
select a specific asset field (with all available fields listed in the drop-down \
list box) and search for text which matches its current value.  The latter search \
is very similar to the text search for node names described above.
        
search.optionsdescript8=Also note that you can quickly search for all nodes which \
have asset information assigned by clicking the <em>List all nodes with asset \
info</em> link.

the <em>Acknowledge Selected Events</em> at the bottom of the page.  \
Acknowledging an event gives users the ability to take personal responsibility \

<em>unacknowledge</em> it, making it available again to all users' views.
event.descript3=If you have a specific event identifier for which you want a \

notification.outstandingandacknowledged=Outstanding and Acknowledged NOtices
notification.descript1=When important events are detected by OpenNMS, users may \
receive a <em>notice</em>, a descriptive message sent automatically to a pager, \
an email address, or both. In order to receive notices, the user must have their \
notification information configured in their user profile (see your Administrator \
for assistance), notices must be <em>on</em> (see the upper right corner of this \
window), and an important event must be received.
notification.descript2=From this panel, you may: <strong>Check your outstanding \
notices</strong>, which displays all unacknowledged notices sent to your user \
ID; <strong>View all outstanding notices</strong>, which displays all \
unacknowledged notices for all users; or <strong>View all acknowledged \
notices</strong>, which provides a summary of all notices sent and acknowledged \
for all users.      
notification.descript3=You may also search for notices associated with a specific \
user ID by entering that user ID in the <strong>Check notices for user</strong> \
text box. And finally, you can jump immediately to a page with details specific \
to a given notice identifier by entering that numeric identifier in the \
<strong>Get notice detail</strong> text box. Note that this is particularly \
useful if you are using a numeric paging service and receive the numeric notice \
identifier as part of the page.
 
notification.escalation=Notification Escalation
notification.escalationdescript=Once a notice is sent, it is considered \
<em>outstanding</em> until someone <em>acknowledge</em>s receipt of the notice \
via the OpenNMS Notification interface.&nbsp; If the event that triggered the \
notice was related to managed network devices or systems, the \
<strong>Network/Systems</strong> group will be notified, one by one, with a \
notice sent to the next member on the list only after 15 minutes has elapsed \
since the last message was sent. This progression through the list, or \
<em>escalation</em>, can be stopped at any time by acknowledging the notice. \
Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as acknowledging the event \
which triggered the notice. If all members of the group have been notified and \
the notice has not been acknowledged, the notice will be escalated to the \
<strong>Management</strong> group, where all members of that group will be \
notified at once with no 15 minute escalation interval.
