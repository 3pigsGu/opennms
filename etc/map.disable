# File to enable mapping in OpenNMS
#
# In order to enable access to the maps in OpenNMS
# move this file to $OPENNMS_HOME/etc/map.enable.
#
# Note: The initial generation of the map will use
# a lot of memory and a lot of CPU. Also, you will
# need to have a browser that supports SVG. At the
# moment, only Internet Explorer supports the SVG
# Plug-in from Adobe:
#
# http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/?image/svg+xml
#
# but it is supposedly possible to build SVG
# support into Mozilla.
